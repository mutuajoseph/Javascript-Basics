// Introduction to events

/* 
An event is a action that occurs in the web browser, which the web browser feedbacks to you so 
that you can respond to it.

Each event executed may have an event handler(also known as an event listener) that is executed when the event oocurs.

*/

// Example 1

// Creating an event that handles on click. An alert message pops up once the button is clicked

// Access the element 
const click = document.querySelector('#click')

// Add an event to the element
click.addEventListener('click', afterClick)

// create a function than will be exexuted once the event occurs
function afterClick(e){
    alert("You have just clicked a button")
    // Event object type 
    console.log(`you have clicked ${e.type}`)
    // By using the preventDefault property the default behaviour of the event is change 
    // BUt the event is still executed
    e.preventDefault()
}


// Event Bubbling 

// This is whereby an event starts from the specific element and then flows upward toward the least specific element (i.e the document or the window)
//  When you click the button, the click event occurs in the following order:
/*  
1.button - which is the element that was clicked 
2.div with the container
3.body
4.html
5.document
*/

// Event Capturing

// This is whereby an event starts from the least specific element flowing downwards to the most specific element
// When you click the button the click event occurs in the following order 

/*
1.document
2.html
3.body
4.div with the id container
5.button
*/

// DOM Level 2 Event flow
/* 
It has three specific phases:
    1. Event capturing - an opportunity to intercept the event is provided 
    2. the target receives the element
    3. Event bubbling - The event responds 

*/

// stopPropagation() property

// It immediately stops the flow of an event through the DOM tree
// However, it does not stop the browsers default behaviour

const pizza = document.querySelector('#pizza')

pizza.addEventListener('click' , function(event){
    console.log('The button was clicked')
    event.stopPropagation();
})

document.body.addEventListener('click', function(event){
    console.log('The body was clicked')
})

// Summary

/*
An event is an action that occurs in the web browser e.g., a mouse click.
Event flow has two main models: event bubbling and event capturing.
DOM Level 2 Event specifies that the event flow has three phases: event bubbling, the event occurs at the exact element, and event capturing.
Use addEventListener() to register an event that connects an event to an event listener
The event object is accessible only within the event listener.
Use preventDefault() method to prevent the default behavior of an event, but does not stop the event flow.
Use stopPropagation() method to stop the flow of an event through the DOM tree, but does not cancel the browser default behavior.

// HANDLING EVENTS IN JS

// An event handler/ event listener listens to the event and respaonds accordingly to the event fires

// Ways To Assign Event Handlers
    // HTML event handler attributes 
    // DOM Level 0 event handlers
    // DOM lEVEL 2 event handlers

// HTML event handler attributes

/* To assign an event handler to an event associated with an HTML element
you can use an HTML attribute with the name of the event handler
*/

// i.e <input type='button' value='Save' onclick="alert('Clicked')">

// An event handler defined in the HTML can call a function defined in a script

/*
 <script>
    function showAlert(){
        alert('Clicked')
    }
 </script>

 <input type="button" value="Save" onclick="showAlert()">
*/


// DOM Level 0 event handlers

//  Every single element has event handler properties and to assign the event handler, you set the property to a function as shows below

// We can also acces the properties inside the element
// This is because the function becomes the method of the button element

let level = document.querySelector('#level')

level.onclick = function(event){
    alert(this.id)
}

// DOM LEVEL 2 EVENT HANDLERS

// It provides two main methods for dealing with the registering and deregistering of event listenerss

    // addEventListener() - register an event handler 
    // removeEventListener() - remove an event handler 

// addEventListener method accepts three arguments
    // An event name
    // An event handler function
    // A Boolean value that instructs the method to call the event handler suring the capture phase or during the bubble phase 

// removeEventListener method removes an event listener that was added via the addEventListener method
// Same arguments are passed 

let success = document.querySelector('#success')

success.addEventListener('click', function(e){
    alert('Congragulations!! Youve Won 1000000$')
})

success.addEventListener('click', successFunc)

function successFunc(e){
    alert(e.type)
}

// Remove the event 
success.removeEventListener('click', successFunc )

// Summary 
/*
There are three ways to assign an event handler: HTML event handler attribute, elementâ€™s event handler property, and addEventListener().
Assign an event handler via the HTML event handler attribute should be avoided.
